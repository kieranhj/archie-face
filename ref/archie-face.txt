Archie-McArchie-Face. Aka Fast Archimedes C Environment.
~~~
Or something. An Archimedes demo framework in C built on ArchieSDK.

What's missing to make this functional?

FRAMEWORK:
- Multiple source files - DONE
- Build object files and link?
- Including binary files in source, e.g. sine table. - STATED w/ debug font
- Calling larger asm functions safely.
- Ideally re-use existing archie-verse asm libs?

LOOP CONTROL:
- Vsync handler - DONE
- Triple buffering - DONE

DEBUG:
- Vsync counter / frame rate - STARTED
- Raster timing
- Debug key presses
- Debug variables
- Debug messages displayed to screen - STARTED
- printf to emulator log file (without slowdown) would be great! :)s

LIBS:
- Memcopy fast
- Memclr / Memset fast - STARTED
- Linked list?
- Random etc.

FIXED-POINT MATHS:
- Macros
- Sine & cosine tables + generation
- Vector lib
- Matrix lib

DRAWING:
- Points - STARTED
- Lines - STARTED
- Triangles
- Circles
