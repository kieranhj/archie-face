Archie-McArchie-Face. Aka Fast Archimedes C Environment.
~~~
Or something. An Archimedes demo framework in C built on ArchieSDK.

What's missing to make this functional?

FRAMEWORK:
- Multiple source files - DONE
- Build object files and link?
- Including binary files in source, e.g. sine table. - STARTED w/ debug font
- Calling larger asm functions safely.
- Ideally re-use existing archie-verse asm libs?
- Clear BSS on init! - DONE
- Settle on types (int32_t vs i32 vs something else?) - what to use for FP?

LOOP CONTROL:
- Vsync handler - DONE
- Triple buffering - DONE

DEBUG:
- Vsync counter / frame rate - STARTED
- Raster timing - DONE
- Debug key presses - DONE
- Debug variables - DONE
- Debug messages displayed to screen - STARTED (NEEDS OPTIMISING)
- printf to emulator log file (without slowdown) would be great! :)s

LIBS:
- Memcopy fast
- Memclr / Memset fast - STARTED
- Linked list?
- Random etc.

FIXED-POINT MATHS:
- Macros - DONE
- Sine & cosine tables + generation - DONE
- Vector lib
- Matrix lib

DRAWING:
- Points - STARTED
- Lines - STARTED
- Triangles
- Circles


Make a PC build!
=> At some point create a bare-bones Archie API and implement a PC window port (using GLEW?)
- Video / screen mode
- Clear screen etc.
- Plotting points etc.
- Plotting text / debug etc.
- Keyboard / mouse input
